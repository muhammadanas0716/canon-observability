## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue

- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Security Best Practices

When using Canon in production:

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review redaction configurations to ensure PII is properly handled
- Use appropriate sampling rates for your use case
- Validate event schemas in development before deploying
- Monitor emitted events for sensitive data leakage

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance
4. Release a security advisory and coordinate with package registries
